<h4><a name="Preface" id="Preface">PREFACE</a></h4>

<p>The original of this tale is in Demotic Egyptian, in prose, on a
fragmentary papyrus dated 'the first month of winter, in the fifteenth
year' of some king unnamed. Palaeographical evidence suggests some date
about 100 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> My own education has been neglected in the matter of
Demotic, and I know the tale only from the literal translation which
accompanies the text in Dr. Griffith's <i>Stories of the High Priests of
Memphis</i>. In that form, however, it so fascinated me that I presently
found myself, to the neglect of more urgent duties, putting it into
English verse and filling up the gaps in the narrative. I have tried to
preserve the style and often the exact words of the original, as
rendered by Dr. Griffith, but in other respects temptations have been
great and I have not resisted them.</p>

<p>The names present some difficulties. In Demotic, if I understand aright,
the vowels are not written and the consonants often do not mean what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
they seem to mean. The hero's name is spelt, roughly speaking,
N('y)-nfr-k'-Pth, the phantom lady's Ty-bwbwe; the priest's is written
Stne, but was probably pronounced, so Dr. Griffith tells me, S&#283;t&#244;n or
S&#283;t&#226;n.</p>

<p>While doing the verses I was constantly reminded of certain Egyptian
illuminations by Miss Florence Kingsford, now Mrs. Sydney Cockerell,
which I had seen some years ago, and she has been so kind as to provide
the book with a frontispiece and tail-piece.</p>

<p>Those who desire further information about Setne will find it in the
introduction to Dr. Griffith's learned and delightful book (Clarendon
Press, 1900).</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Setne Khamuas</span>, son of <span class="smcap">Rameses</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High Priest of <span class="smcap">Ptah</span>, beneath his garden trees<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Dwelt with his wife and children; wise was he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Books of power and ancient Masteries.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And much he pondered on a tale they told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How <span class="smcap">Nefrekepta</span>, dead in days of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Held still the Book of <span class="smcap">Hermes</span> which is <span class="smcap">Thoth</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hid in his tomb, and never loosed his hold.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And longing for that Book so pierced him through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He called to him his brother <span class="smcap">An-Herru</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The son of <span class="smcap">Menkh-Art</span>, saying: 'Brother mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be with me in a deed I have to do.'<br /></span>
</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And he said: 'I am with thee till my doom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Find me.' And <span class="smcap">Setne</span> said: 'I seek the tomb<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of <span class="smcap">Nefrekepta</span> dead, and take the Book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Book of <span class="smcap">Thoth</span> hid in its inmost room.'<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That night they found the tomb, and <span class="smcap">An-Herru</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stayed at the door, but <span class="smcap">Setne</span> passing through<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On seven great doors and seven windings spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His spells, and found the room; and all was true.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For there lay <span class="smcap">Nefrekepta</span> in his pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Book beneath his head; and at his side<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The ghosts sate of a woman and a boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shadows beside the dead; and <span class="smcap">Setne</span> cried:<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ye thron&#232;d Shadows, whosoe'er ye be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou, dead <span class="smcap">Pharaoh</span>, tombed in majesty,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All hail! I, <span class="smcap">Setne</span>, scribe and Priest of <span class="smcap">Ptah</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Command thy Book be rendered up to me,<br /></span>
</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Book of <span class="smcap">Thoth</span> which lies beneath thy head.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then never word nor sign came from the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But the two Shadows lifted up their arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lamenting, and the woman swift outspread<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her hand to save the Book, and cried: 'Aha!<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Setne Khamuas</span>, is the will of <span class="smcap">Ra</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Not yet fulfilled upon us? This is I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Ahure</span> of the race of <span class="smcap">Merneb-Ptah</span>.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Therefore give ear, and let the Book of Gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tempt thee no more, till all my tale be told.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It happened in the days of <span class="smcap">Merneb-Ptah</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long days, when the King was very old,<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And had no son nor daughter; in their room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A son's son and a daughter's daughter, whom<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thou seest, <span class="smcap">Nefrekepta</span> the Good Scribe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And me who watch beside him in this tomb.<br /></span>
</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And <span class="smcap">Pharaoh</span> mused and spake: 'Go near and far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring me the lordliest of my chiefs of war<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Feast on the third day; call me all that are.'<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So <span class="smcap">Pharaoh</span> spake; but lo, exceedingly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did I love <span class="smcap">Nefrekepta</span> and he me.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And much I feared that <span class="smcap">Pharaoh</span> at that feast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would take some youth and maid of high degree,<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A war-lord's daughter and a war-lord's son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fast bind <span class="smcap">Nefrekepta</span> to the one,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And me to the other; so his race would grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we two meet no more beneath the sun.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now <span class="smcap">Pharaoh's</span> ancient Steward loved me well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <span class="smcap">Nefrekepta</span> too; and it befell,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">One day he watched me and the second day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke: '<span class="smcap">Ahure</span>, surely I can spell<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A story that is written in four eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou lovest <span class="smcap">Nefrekepta</span> and likewise<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He loveth thee.' And I cried out: 'O friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak unto <span class="smcap">Pharaoh</span> quick, ere this day dies!<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pray that he give me to my cousin straight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor seek to make us two live separate.'<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And he said: 'I will speak; for so the law<br /></span>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The King's sons wed the daughters of the King.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then all my heart was like a water-spring<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Leaping; and soon he went and soon returned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad, and reported of his counselling:<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I spake to <span class="smcap">Pharaoh</span>, saying: "Lord, may life<br /></span>

<span class="i1">And <span class="smcap">Pharaoh</span> spoke not, but his brow grew dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With trouble; and I said: "O King, for sure<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou hast some grief; say what doth vex thy brow?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <span class="smcap">Pharaoh</span> said: "None vexeth me but thou.<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Next day the hours passed and the feast was set<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not as of old, my heart being desolate.<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And <span class="smcap">Pharaoh</span> spake: '<span class="smcap">Ahure</span>, was it thou<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And there I laughed; and <span class="smcap">Pharaoh</span> laughed again,<br /></span>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
